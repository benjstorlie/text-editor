## Comments

1. I have to say, I don't 100% understand everything here.

2. I don't understand why indexedDB is being used here if it's only being used to store a single string.  Why are both indexedDB and local storage being used here?  Is one persisting longer than the other?  Do you only have access to one when you install it?
